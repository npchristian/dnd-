&emsp;<b>Age</b>. Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.
&emsp;<b>Alignment</b>. Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and thye are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.

&emsp;<b>Fey Ancestry</b>. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.
&emsp;<b>Trance</b>.Elves don’t need to sleep. instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through the years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
&emsp;<b>Languages</b>. You can speak, read, and write common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.
&emsp;<b>Subrace</b>. Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. Choose one of these subraces. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still further (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower subrace.
